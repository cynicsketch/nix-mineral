        IPv6 router advertisements which are accepted.
        Malicious router advertisements have the potential to create a MITM
        attack by modifying the default gateway, cause a DoS/DDoS attack when
        flooded, or initiate unauthorized IPv6 access.

        `off` - Disable all IPv6 router advertisements.
        `restrict` - Restrict the parameters of IPv6 router advertisements which are accepted.
        `on` - Enable all IPv6 router advertisements (effectively, do nothing).

        Router advertisements are never authenticated, and can be sent and
        received by any device on the local network.

        Setting to `off` or `restrict` may cause issues with IPv6 address autoconfiguration or
        host discovery.
