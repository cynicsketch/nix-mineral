# Sections from madaidan's guide requiring manual user intervention:

# 2.9 (Paid software)
# 2.11 (Unique for all hardware, inconvenient)
# 4 (Sandboxing must be done manually)
# 6 (Compiling everything is inconvenient)
# 8.6 (No option, not for all systems)
# 8.7 (Inconvenient, depends on specific user behavior)
# 10.1 (Up to user to determine hostname and username)
# 10.2 (Up to user to determine timezone, locale, and keymap)
# 10.5.3 (Not packaged)
# 10.6 (Not packaged, inconvenient and not within threat model)
# 11.1 (Manual removal is SUID/SGID is manual)
# 11.2 (No known way to set umask declaratively systemwide, use your shellrc
# or home manager to do so)
# 14 (Rather than enforce password quality with PAM, expect user
# to enforce their own password quality; faildelay is, however,
# implemented here)
# 21.1 (Out of scope)
# 21.2 (See above)
# 21.3 (User's job to set passwords)
# 21.3.1 (See above)
# 21.3.2 (See above)
# 21.3.3 (See above)
# 21.4 (Non-declarative setup, experimental)

# ABOUT THE DEFAULTS:
# The default config harms performance and usability in many ways, focusing
# almost entirely on hardening alone.
#
# There are also some optional software substitutions and additions in the
# overrides that are recommended but *not enabled* by default:
#
# sudo ---> doas (For reduced attack surface; although less audited)
# systemd-timesyncd ---> chrony (For NTS support)
# linux_hardened kernel*
#
# (No longer recommended as of July 25, 2024. The patchset being behind by
# about a week or so is one thing, but the package as included in nixpkgs is
# way too infrequently updated, being several weeks or even months behind.
# Therefore, it is recommended to choose an LTS kernel like 5.15, 6.1, or 6.6
# in your own system configuration.*)
#
# USBGuard is also *enabled* by default, which may inconvenience some users.
# 
# All of this can, and should be addressed using the overrides file.
# "nm-overrides.nix"
